Based on the following context, generate a valid JSON object for a Bible quiz.

The JSON object must follow these rules:
1. Each key must be a question derived from the context.
2. Each value must be a dictionary with:
	- 'options': A dictionary containing exactly 4 keys: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'. Each key must have a potential answer as its value.
	- 'answer': The correct answer (one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D') based on the context.

Output Rules:
	- The output must be a valid JSON object with no extra text, explanations, or formatting like ```json or ###Quiz Question.
	- Ensure the questions and answers are derived strictly from the context.
    - Questions must not use generic names like "Question 1" or "Quiz Question."
    - Answers must stay within the boundaries of the context. Do not invent answers or questions.
    - There should be 1 objectively correct answer and 3 objectively wrong answers in your 'options'.

Here is an example of the required format:
{{
	"What was the first miracle Jesus performed?": {{
		"options": {{
			"A": "Turning water into wine",
			"B": "Feeding the 5,000",
			"C": "Healing a blind man",
			"D": "Walking on water"
		}},
		"answer": "A"
	}},
	"Where did Jesus perform his first miracle?": {{
		"options": {{
			"A": "Cana",
			"B": "Bethlehem",
			"C": "Jerusalem",
			"D": "Nazareth"
		}},
		"answer": "A"
	}}
}}

NOTE: Do NOT use the above example questions in your generated questions. The above example is just a format example.

Context:
	{contextual_text}

Now generate 3 quiz questions in the JSON format described above.
